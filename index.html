<h2>Why Us ?</h2>
<p>Scarlet offers a new community for developers to submit their paid apps and allow users to seemlessly protect themselves from revokes. Our goal getting into Scarlet is to give everybody access to a store that doesn't tell people to do the workarounds. Instead we created an app with every user in mind to bring a smooth experience.</p>

<h2>True repo system</h2>
<p>
Scarlet offers the first ever true repo system for all users. <br> What is a true repo system ? - Our repo system supports jailbreak repos and jailed users can make use of some features added to the side. <br> These include 1. Force install jailbroken apps while jailed <br> 2. Automatically/Manually injects the tweak into the app it's meant for(no jailbreak required) <br> We include native repos specifically designed for Scarlet. Developers have the ability to choose a dylibs/debs to inject into the specificed app.</p>

<h2>Made by Pros</h2>
<p>
Scarlet's GUI was designed by Xeviks. <br> He has brought color, vibrancy, movement, and modernity - yet keeping the look simplistic. <br> DebianArch is the solo-dev of the Scarlet app and is bringing innovative features to reshape the community that was left unchanged.

Thanks for using the AxelClover edition of Scarlet. This is ad-free and I am not responsible for what happens.
